# Advent of CSS 2023

This is my attempts at the [Advent of CSS 2023](https://www.adventofcss.com/) challenges

Caution: I'm using this for my own learnings and to improve my CSS skills, this may not be the best reference for you as I'm generally a full-stack dev, not a super-awesome front-end dev / designer / UX guru.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This repo is based on the Vite React + TypeScript template.

Do the usual `npm i` and `npm run dev` to run this locally.

None of this is production ready code btw.

# Storybook

Storybook is also installed in this repo to view the components in isolation.

`npm run storybook` to get it running locally.
